Task 1: Phishing Link Scanner
This project is part of my internship at Brainwave Matrix Solutions, where I built a simple Python program to scan and detect phishing URLs. The scanner checks URLs and helps identify unsafe or suspicious links, contributing to the prevention of phishing attacks.

Task 2: Password Strength Evaluator
This Python program evaluates the strength of a password based on its length and complexity. It provides feedback on how secure the password is and offers suggestions for improvement. The tool checks the following:

Length: Ensures the password meets a minimum length requirement.
Complexity: Evaluates whether the password includes a mix of lowercase, uppercase, digits, and special characters.
Overall Strength: Provides feedback ranging from weak to excellent based on the password's length and complexity.
