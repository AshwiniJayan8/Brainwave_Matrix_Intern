Task 1: Phishing Link Scanner
As part of Task 1, this Python project is a phishing URL scanner. Users can enter a URL into the application, and it uses rules such as IP-based URLs, phishing-related phrases, and suspicious top-level domains (TLDs) to determine whether the URL is secure or phishing. It is also an option for the user to check more than one URL in a single session.
